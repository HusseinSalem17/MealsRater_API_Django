1. https://127.0.0.1:8080/api/meals/meal_pk/rate_meal ==> POST
    request data = stars
    request user = user or user name
    stars + user from request
    pk from url
    end point to update\create rate for specific meal using Meal ViewSet not rate
    views > add the custom function with the @action decorator

2. Meal list API to show the averae rating and number of ratings
    models > add custom function\method in the model to calculate the avg and sum
    serializers > add the avg and sum to the fields


** Better to write the business in the model file that is related to the model
models in django make caching, but views be load on computing
